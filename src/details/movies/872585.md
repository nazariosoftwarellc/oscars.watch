[Dan Jolin](https://twitter.com/danjolin), [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/oppenheimer/):

> _Oppenheimer_ is based on _American Prometheus_, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s wide-spined biography of the theoretical physicist who "fathered" the atomic bomb.

> A three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller, _Oppenheimer_ seldom slows down except to ruminate on questions of all-consuming guilt, as it imagines a vivid psychology lurking within its protagonist’s conscious mind, plagued by doomsday visions that serve as both warning and indictment for humankind.

[Manohla Dargis](https://linktr.ee/Manohla), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/movies/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan.html):

> [[Director Christopher] Nolan](/people/525) goes deep and long on the building of the bomb, a fascinating and appalling process, but he doesn’t restage the attacks; there are no documentary images of the dead or panoramas of cities in ashes, decisions that read as his ethical absolutes.

> Nolan’s chief fascination, of course, is Oppenheimer himself, whom [[Cillian] Murphy](/people/2037) plays as a grand enigma — icy at times and effortlessly charming at others, sympathetic to leftist revolutionary causes but happy to bury those sympathies as he begins steering the Manhattan Project.

> Murphy imbues the scientist with so many warring traits, impulses, and instincts — he’s peerlessly perceptive and blind to his own faults; ambitious and uneasy in the spotlight; self-possessed and ultimately unsure of his choices—that his countenance resonates as a topographical map of his increasingly harried soul. It’s a magnificent marquee turn from the _Peaky Blinders_ star.

[Christian Holub](https://twitter.com/cmholub), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan/):

> [Robert Downey Jr.](/people/3223) plays Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer's rival for control over postwar nuclear policy, and uses his own considerable acting powers to carve out a sizable portion of the film for himself.

> It’s not an exaggeration to say that Downey does some of the best work of his long career here...

> [The supporting cast includes] Florence Pugh, and [Emily Blunt](/people/5081), and Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Jason Clarke, Matthew Modine, Olivia Thirlby, Dane DeHaan, Alden Ehrenreich… it’s actually quicker to list who’s not in Oppenheimer.
