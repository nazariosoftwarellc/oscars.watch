> Cord Jefferson’s _American Fiction_ is a cagey, cerebral dramedy about a joke that backfires on its author, a stone-faced literature professor named Thelonious ["Monk"] Ellison ([Jeffrey Wright](/people/2954)).

> In a burst of frustration, and having just watched a bit of _Get Rich or Die Tryin’_ on a hotel TV, [Monk] scribbles out a compendium of over-the-top clichés about urban suffering under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh, [and] titles it “My Pafology.”

> [Publishers give it] a huge offer, leaving Monk in conflicted anguish.

> _American Fiction_ keeps its critical eye focused on the gullible nature and patronizing tone of white people who are incapable of appreciating or engaging with Black intellectualism in any meaningful way.

> The satire isn’t as brutal as it could have been — and perhaps needed to be — but overall, I thought _American Fiction_ was a rousing success that got me thinking about my own experiences.

> I could identify with how much my own Blackness has been used to pigeonhole me, over the course of my writing career, by editors who have either pitched only Black-themed articles to me or expected my film knowledge to consist solely of Madea, Spike Lee, slavery movies, and _Soul Plane_.

> Wright is commanding in the lead role, and he has fantastic chemistry with all of the cast.

> Capturing Jeffrey Wright trying to eat an olive is one of the reasons the camera was invented.

> However, _American Fiction_ often treats its Black women as accessories to the story.
