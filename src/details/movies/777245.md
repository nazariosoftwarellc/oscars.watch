> For the past few years, the women in this isolated religious community have been drugged and assaulted in their sleep, and told the culprits were ghosts. Unbearably bleak, yes, and it actually happened...
>
> The men have been imprisoned in a nearby town, awaiting bail, so the women meet in a purgatory-like hayloft to talk about what to do: nothing, stay and fight, or leave.

> Polley’s dialogue—often borrowing directly from Toews’ text—is compelling without the necessity of graphic depictions of traumatic events. Instead, it focuses on fragmentary flashbacks of an assault’s aftermath to demonstrate its emotional impact, trusting that the audience understands the horror of sexual violation without demanding that we experience it by proxy.

> It would easy to call _Women Talking_ a #MeToo movie, but it’s a lot more than that. These aren’t trendy conversations; they’re long-held struggles that people of all genders have faced for generations.

> Polley lends the central conversation a visual gravitas normally reserved for epics: She shot the movie on the widest canvas possible using the same kind of equipment that captured Star Wars landscapes, and applied a muted color grading to every frame.

> That [the conversation] never totally suffocates is a credit to Polley’s visible intention to leave no stone unturned and, most of all, to the extraordinary cast — a melange of talent who collectively don’t sound a dud note.

> Claire Foy is a force to be reckoned with as Salome in _Women Talking_. Her maternal fury at the men for what they've done ignites her scenes; when Salome isn't barely containing her rage, she's desperately trying to hold herself together for her girls.

> [_Women Talking_] might just inspire more works of wild female imagination.
