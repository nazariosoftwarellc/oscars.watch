> [_The Fabelmans_ is] Spielberg’s most personal film, one that gorgeously revives the memories of his childhood and youth with a lavish sense of wistfulness and an aptly Hollywood-ized, fable-like touch.

> Sammy is a semi-autobiographical stand-in for Spielberg... the film follows [him] from ages 7 to 18, as his observant Jewish family moves from New Jersey to Arizona to California. Sammy falls deeper in love with moviemaking while he reckons with the growing tension between his parents, Mitzi (Michelle Williams) and Burt (Paul Dano).

> Because it's Spielberg, it's all beautifully, meticulously rendered, and not a little glazed in wistful sentiment: an infinitely tender, sometimes misty ode to the people who raised him and the singular passion for cinema that shaped him.

> [Michelle] Williams gives one of her greatest performances in the role of a woman confronting her own tug-of-war between stability and self-expression.

> [Paul Dano] is a super interesting performance... [he's] constantly internalizing his son’s waning attention and his marriage falling apart at the hands of who he thought was his best friend, while all the time remaining a pleasant human being.

[Dana Stevens](https://twitter.com/thehighsign), [Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2022/11/fabelmans-steven-spielberg-movie-review-best-picture-oscars.html):

> Spielberg captures the texture of Jewish family life in scenes that are affectionate while remaining attentive to this family’s specific style of dysfunction.

[Richard Lawson](https://twitter.com/rilaws), [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/09/spielberg-the-fabelmans-review-awards-insider):

> _The Fabelmans_ is so summative of the filmmaker’s memories and motivation that it almost feels like a goodbye.
