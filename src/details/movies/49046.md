> German filmmaker Edward Berger has brought _All Quiet on the Western Front_ to life with a fresh perspective — and the first German adaptation of a story deeply ingrained into the very DNA of the country.
>
> Set in the midst of World War I, the film’s focus narrows on Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer) and his small group of friends that get lured into war by the promise of heroism and patriotism.

> This is a war movie from the perspective of the losers, visually spectacular but by turns infuriating and heartbreaking.

> Rather than portray its characters as glorious heroes bravely fighting for their country, or even ending the film on an optimistic note, _All Quiet on the Western Front_ is tragic from beginning to end, and is relentlessly, almost unbearably, bleak.

> Berger drives [the] point home studiously, meticulously, poetically, and by the end, a little repetitively.

> Nobody could mistake _All Quiet on the Western Front_ for anything other than an anti-war film, but the deafening, careering action... still works to create an unhealthy surge in the viewer. That contradiction is best appreciated on the biggest screen with the loudest sound.

> Coupling a minimalist (albeit loud-and-thumping) score by Volker Bertelmann and a cold, unfeeling color scheme by cinematographer James Friend gives a menacing, unwaveringly serious savagery to Berger’s aesthetic.

[Jamelle Bouie](https://jamellebouie.net), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/17/opinion/all-quiet-on-the-western-front.html):

> This new movie has a lot going for it as a film depicting World War I; the problem is that it isn’t actually _All Quiet on the Western Front_.
