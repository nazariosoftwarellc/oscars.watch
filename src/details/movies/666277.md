>  Is it normal to wonder what might have been—to ponder what your life might be like if you’d chosen another partner—or is it a betrayal of the person who sleeps beside you every night?

> [Director Celine] Song’s sweeping romance, _Past Lives_, spans decades and crosses continents as it depicts a woman reconnecting with her childhood sweetheart, but it deploys a delicate rhythm of absence, distance, and silence.

[Richard Lawson](https://twitter.com/rilaws), [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/01/past-lives-sundance-movie-review):

> It is a very tough thing indeed to make a film that is at once restrained and brimming with feeling.

[David Ehrlich](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich), [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/past-lives-movie-review-1234802344/):

> it’s a movie less interested in tempting its heroine with “the one who got away” than it is in allowing her to reconcile with the version of herself he kept as a souvenir when she left.

> Shooting on 35mm film, Shabier Kirchner, who did such good work on Steve McQueen’s _Small Axe_, finds a luscious, fluid New York to compare favourably with different beauties in Woody Allen’s _Manhattan_ and Alfred Hitchcock’s _Rear Window_.

> This is Greta Lee’s show: she’s magnificent in the role, by turns steely, fearful, yearning and impish.

> For some, the lack of melodrama or fireworks may prove an emotional deterrent in _Past Lives_. For others, including me, the right movie makes you care and believe. And this is one of them.
