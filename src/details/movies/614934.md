> [_Elvis_] dumps you into a sealed drum, blasts hysterically re-edited versions of the familiar music into that sealed space and rattles it furiously until you pass out or — ears bleeding — give in to the benevolent torture and confess everything.

> All of Luhrmann’s maximalist flavors are on display: Breakneck editing, splashy scenery, crotch shots, [and] selective overacting.

> Of the actors who have previously tried to bottle Elvis’s lightning-like magic... none has come close to the physical, emotional, electrical energy that throbs through Austin Butler’s titular performance here.

> Presley’s family didn’t just sign off on the film — they praised it, primarily because of Butler’s portrayal.

[Katie Walsh](https://twitter.com/katiewalshstx), [Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2022-06-23/elvis-review-baz-luhrmann-austin-butler):

> The story is told from [Elvis manager Colonel Tom] Parker’s perspective, a curious choice.

[David Ehrlich](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich), [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/elvis-review-baz-luhrmann-1234728121/):

> The problem here is that Luhrmann’s Colonel Parker — Tom Hanks in a "true true" performance defined by a fat suit, a fake nose, and an accent that I can only describe as the "Kentucky Fried Goldmember" — is possibly the most insufferable movie character ever conceived.

[Richard Lawson](https://twitter.com/rilaws), [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/05/elvis-movie-review-baz-luhrmann-austin-butler):

> The film does at least take advantage of some present-day hindsight: it is careful to note that Presley and other white rockers like him owed a huge debt to Black musicians who were criminally undervalued at the time (and now).

[Robert Daniels](https://twitter.com/812filmreviews), [RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/elvis-movie-review-2022):

> _Elvis_ certainly works as a jukebox, and it does deliver exactly what you’d expect from a Luhrmann movie. But it never gets close to Presley.
