> It’s the spring of 1928 and Pádraic (Colin Farrell) lives on the island of Inisherin with his sister Siobhan (Kerry Condon) and his donkey Jenny. His best friend is Colm (Brendan Gleeson), a fiddler: or at least he was until very recently. He’s just decided that he no longer wants to be friends with Pádraic.

> For Pádraic, this is just the start of an agonizing spiral of self-doubt that turns into a nightmare and leaves no one unchanged.

> [The film] speaks to the terrifying thought we’ve all had at one point or another: what if our friends secretly think we’re dreadful dullards and only hang around out of pity?

> It’s an end-of-friendship breakup movie that swings between the hilarious, the horrifying and the heartbreaking in magnificent fashion.

> Gleeson’s fearsome, glowering Colm is an impressive creation, almost like a [Samuel Beckett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett) character in his saturnine self-containment.

> It’s Farrell who really anchors the film. It’s tricky to play a character who every other character refers to only as a dullard, and then to make him so worthy of our sympathy and pain. But when the actor’s eyebrows twist up like a pair of divining rods, he’s able to push that "kicked puppy" look into something profoundly tragic.

> [Barry Keoghan plays] the abused son of a local police officer who sneakily claims one of the film’s finest scenes through a disarming—if unrequited—romantic confession.
