> [_Avatar: The Way Of Water_ is] a leap beyond even what [director James Cameron] pulled off with the first film, a phantasmagorical, fully immersive waking dream of a movie in which something impossible is happening on-screen at almost every moment.

> Jake Sully and his family, on the run from the RDA, must learn to live and work among the water dwellers.

> We’re introduced to a spectacular array of new creatures, foremost among them the tulkun, whale-like marine mammals the size of a football field who are sentient beings capable of communicating with humans.

> The world both above and below the waterline is a thing to behold, a sensory overload of sound and color so richly tactile that it feels psychedelically, almost spiritually sublime.

> Complicating the illusion in a way that alternately enhances _The Way of Water_ and risks interrupting its flow is a variable frame rate that switches between 24 and 48fps from one shot to the next, as if God (or Eywa) were speed-ramping life itself.

> Three hours and 12 minutes sounds excessive, but there is something decidedly decadent about really committing that much time to a movie in a theater. When the filmmaker is purposeful with that time, as Cameron is and many others have been before him, it’s a uniquely rewarding experience.

> Cameron actually succeeds at replaying the hits without feeling repetitive, which is impressive given that _The Way of Water_ has the same basic structure as its predecessor.
