> _Poor Things_ is a steampunk-retrofuturist Victorian freakout and macabre black-comic horror, adapted by screenwriter Tony McNamara from the 1992 novel by Alasdair Gray and directed by the absurdist virtuoso Yorgos Lanthimos.

> To Bella Baxter, a literal child in a woman’s body, everything is new and everything is interesting — words, bodies, maps, music, sugar, sex — and Lanthimos matches her fascination with rampant glee.

> It’s a showcase for [[Emma] Stone](/people/54693), who rapidly goes from preverbal toddling to childlike wonder to restless adolescence... her performance displays the balance and dexterity of a chainsaw juggler.

> [Mark] Ruffalo, meanwhile, is hysterically funny in a way you’ve never seen him before. He’s both a charismatic Lothario and a preening buffoon.

> Boldly realized with taffy-colored production design, brain-bending sets stuffed with enough easter egg unrealities to fill the most difficult 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, and wildly over-the-top Victorian costumes that look as if made by a schizoid seamstress on too many tabs of acid, _Poor Things_ is also hysterically funny and the raunchiest movie you’re likely to see all year.

> Holly Waddington’s non-conformist costumes are gorgeously weird and surgical.

> Robbie Ryan’s cinematography captures [everything] with an attention to color and light that’s magical, along with Lanthimos’ customary penchant for the intermittent skewed view of a fish-eye lens.
