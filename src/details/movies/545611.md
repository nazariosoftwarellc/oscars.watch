> A movie that reconciles the smallness of our lives with the infinity of their potential.

[Jeff Yang](https://twitter.com/originalspin?lang=en), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/08/everything-everywhere-movie-asians-proud/):

> [This movie] felt personal, intimate and almost invasive, like a handwritten message made out to me, tied to a rock and thrown through my childhood bedroom window.

> [The movie is] anchored in an earnest family drama that’s elevated by a series of great performances, particularly from central star Michelle Yeoh.

> To the extent that it’s been produced as a love letter to [[Michelle] Yeoh](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1620), _Everything Everywhere All At Once_ is extremely poignant, giving its 59-year-old star a chance to flex unexpected acting muscles while revisiting the high-flying fight choreography that made her a global icon back in the 1990s.

> There’s not a weak link in the cast but it’s a special joy to see — and hear — [[Ke Huy] Quan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ke_Huy_Quan) again. His abiding sweetness may be the movie’s deepest reservoir of feeling.

[Marya E. Gates](https://twitter.com/oldfilmsflicker), [RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-2022):

> In a true breakout performance from [Stephanie Hsu](https://www.themoviedb.org/person/1381186), Joy represents a growing generational divide. Joy carries the weight of Evelyn’s fractured relationship with her grandfather and the disappointments of an American dream unattained. Her queerness \[is\] as foreign to her mother as the country was when she herself first arrived.

[Ann Anlin Cheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Anlin_Cheng), [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/05/04/everything-everywhere-asian-american-pessimism/):

> It’s not only that the multiverse acts as a metaphor for the immigrant Asian American experience, or a convenient parable for the dislocations and personality splits suffered by hyphenated (that is, “Asian-American”) citizens. It also becomes a rather heady vehicle for confronting and negotiating Asian-pessimism.
