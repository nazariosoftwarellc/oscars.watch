> Just when it seemed like _The Irishman_ might’ve been Scorsese’s final word on [the gangster movie], they’ve pulled him back in for another movie full of brutal killings, bitter voiceovers, and biting conclusions about the corruptive spirit of American capitalism.

> I’m hard-pressed to think of another modern filmmaker of similar stature who’s tried something comparably daring on such a large canvas, and with so many people watching.

[David Klion](https://twitter.com/DavidKlion), [The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/175073/killers-flower-moon-groundbreaking-achievement-martin-scorsese-review):

> Scorsese extensively researched and consulted with the Osage to ensure an accurate and three-dimensional portrayal of their society.

> Scorsese truly tried, but the reality is this is yet another film about Indigenous people, in this case, the Osage, written and directed by white people and adapted from a book written by a white man.

> [_Killers_ is] one of the most rewarding projects of his long career, a sign that Scorsese has no intention of fading away — even as the film landscape transforms around him yet again.

[Dana Stevens](https://twitter.com/thehighsign), [Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2023/10/killers-of-the-flower-moon-movie-martin-scorsese.html?via=rss):

> I'll preserve the beautiful surprise of [the ending of _Killers_] by noting only that it represents an unprecedented moment of self-disclosure and self-critique from an artist keenly aware of the moral responsibility he bears in recounting a true-crime story in which his ancestors, and those of any white member of the audience, were on the side of the criminals.
