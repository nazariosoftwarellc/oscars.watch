> Anchoring everything [in [_Oppenheimer_](/movies/872585)] is the captivating face of [Cillian] Murphy, whose crystalline blue eyes offset his sunken cheeks to create an almost ghoulish effect. That visage occupies the entirety of the screen for much of the film, and Murphy is talented enough that you never want to look away.

> The close-ups on Murphy's face as Oppenheimer thinks through the 20th century's thorniest problems are as compelling as the film's atomic explosions, and as deserving of the biggest screen possible.

> Murphy, with his frost-blue eyes fixed in a permanent thousand-yard stare, keeps the viewer (and the people around him) at arm’s length.

[Max Weiss](https://twitter.com/maxthegirl), [Baltimore Magazine](https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/section/artsentertainment/movie-review-oppenheimer/):

> [Cillian Murphy] perfectly embodies the paradoxes of [J. Robert Oppenheimer] — brilliant in science but reckless in his personal life; outwardly cocky but plagued by doubt; relentlessly driven but unbearably tormented.

> Murphy is extraordinary at conveying Oppenheimer’s otherworldly mental capacities and his bouts of self-doubt and depression, but the Irish actor seems about as Jewish as Max von Sydow.
