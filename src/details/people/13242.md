> Paul Giamatti stars in [[_The Holdovers_]](/movies/840430) as Paul Hunham, a curmudgeonly ancient history instructor whose only pleasure seems to be derived from holding his privileged students to account and failing them without regard for political considerations.

> Giamatti — an actor who cannot be compared to any other actor in human history, in any medium — plays a history teacher living resolutely in the past.

> He’s an artist who can make a symphony out of playing 12 different notes of pathetic, and make every dissonant suite sound natural.

[Nick de Semlyan](https://twitter.com/NickdeSemlyen), [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-holdovers/):

> Handing such a role to Giamatti is like handing the keys of a very expensive lab to Oppenheimer.

> In addition to being funny as hell, Giamatti is a brilliant dramatic actor, and he invests his [character's] withering remarks with a French pastry's worth of layers.

[Esther Zuckerman](https://twitter.com/ezwrites), [GQ](https://www.gq.com/story/the-holdovers-is-the-highlight-of-a-very-good-year-for-paul-giamatti):

> As the son of onetime Yale University president A. Bartlett Giamatti, he grew up around both academia and East Coast snobbery. It's clear he knows the rules of this world, and all its injustices, intimately.

[Alison Willmore](https://bsky.app/profile/alisonwillmore.bsky.social), [Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-holdovers-review-paul-giamatti-is-at-his-best.html):
