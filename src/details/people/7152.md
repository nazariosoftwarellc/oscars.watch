> Sandra Hüller, who has already given the year’s chilliest performance as the avaricious SS wife in [Jonathan Glazer](/people/66728)’s [_The Zone of Interest_](/movies/467244), brings froidure and unpleasantries as Sandra, a German-born, France-based novelist accused of killing her male partner.

> [_Anatomy of a Fall_](/movies/915935) is anchored by the powerfully present Hüller, who bleeds and breathes into the environment, even as she stands out.

> [A] showstopping sequence also confirms what many of us already knew, or least highly suspected, which is that Sandra Hüller is one of those once-in-a-generation screen actors that can navigate both beaucoup verbiage — in three languages, no less! — and volatile emotional terrain with the grace of a prima ballerina.

> Her Sandra can be vivid and elusive, warm and guarded, calculating and oddly guileless.

> Hüller’s performance walks a very fine line throughout the film. Her Sandra is both open and unreadable. She seems perfectly sensible and matter-of-fact, and yet there’s the gnawing sense that she’s keeping something from us.
