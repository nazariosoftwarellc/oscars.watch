> William Hale ([Robert] De Niro) is a cattle rancher but more like a king around these parts — indeed, King’s his nickname — a white man who speaks the Osage language and calls himself their best friend.

> Peering out of wireframe glasses, he imbues the character with a repulsive righteousness that is mesmerising to watch.

> De Niro is brutally effective here, dooming a life with a single eyebrow twitch.

> De Niro is magnificently unsettling in the film — it might be the best work he’s done with [[Martin] Scorsese](/people/1032) since _Goodfellas_.

[Matt Singer](https://bsky.app/profile/mattsinger.bsky.social), [ScreenCrush](https://screencrush.com/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review/):

> De Niro, freed from all of the digital de-aging technology that occasionally became a distraction in Scorsese’s otherwise sensational _The Irishman_, gives one of his best performances in years; full of oily charm, underplayed menace, and surprisingly hilarious dark humor.

[David Fear](https://twitter.com/davidlfear), [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review-martin-scorsese-leonardo-dicaprio-robert-deniro-cannes-masterpiece-osage-lily-gladstone-1234735375/):

> [Leonardo] DiCaprio and De Niro’s one-on-one scenes together, it should be said, make you bemoan the fact that it’s taken them this long to follow up on their _This Boy’s Life_ rapport.
