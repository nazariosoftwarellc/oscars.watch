> [Lily] Gladstone’s performance [in [_Killers of the Flower Moon_](/movies/466420)] expands on her memorable breakthrough in Kelly Reichardt’s _Certain Women_.

[Stephanie Zacharek](https://twitter.com/szacharek), [Time](https://time.com/6341118/best-movies-2023/):

> Gladstone’s Mollie is the soul of [[Martin Scorsese](/people/1032)'s] film, and he knows it.

[Richard Brody](https://twitter.com/tnyfrontrow), [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-silent-thunder-of-killers-of-the-flower-moon):

> In _Killers,_ Mollie knows and feels far more than she says, and the depth of her insight is concentrated in Gladstone’s fixed and relentless gaze.

> It’s a beautifully cadenced performance, all the more impressive because Gladstone’s sharing the screen with two of our most celebrated actors.

[Dana Stevens](https://twitter.com/thehighsign), [Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2023/10/killers-of-the-flower-moon-movie-martin-scorsese.html?via=rss):

> Mollie is quiet, watchful, reserved — but never stoic or pitiably long-suffering in the style of a stereotypical onscreen “Indian.”
>
> We see her experience longing, lust, grief, suspicion, forgiveness, and fury, even as she’s obliged to conceal her true feelings—and the extent of her awareness of the deceit all around her—in order to survive in a white-controlled world.
