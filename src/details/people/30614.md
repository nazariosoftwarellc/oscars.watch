> [Ryan] Gosling’s Ken is Beach Ken and that’s his job: Beach.

[Clarisse Loughrey](https://twitter.com/clarisselou), [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/barbie-film-movie-review-b2380412.html):

> Gosling gives an all-timer of a comedic performance, one that’s part-baby, part-Zoolander, part-maniac, and 100 per cent a validation for anyone who ever liked him in 2016’s noir comedy _The Nice Guys_.

[Devan Coggan](https://twitter.com/devancoggan), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/barbie-review/):

> His Ken has very little going on inside his brain, but his heart is brimming with emotion: love and admiration for Barbie, a longing for masculine validation, and a wide-eyed curiosity about the world around him.

> Gosling’s portrait of Ken as a jealous, competitive himbo is absolutely divine, allowing him to show off his comedic chops, Gene Kelly-esque moves, and singing talents. (And abs!)

> Gosling is exceptional here, never losing sight of the comedy required to play a himbo while allowing us an emotional peek into Ken’s wounded soul.
