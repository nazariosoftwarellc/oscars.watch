### Reviews for [_Oppenheimer_](/movies/872585)

[Christian Holub](https://twitter.com/cmholub), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan/):

> Robert Downey Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer's rival for control over postwar nuclear policy, and uses his own considerable acting powers to carve out a sizable portion of the film for himself.

[Nick Schager](https://twitter.com/nschager), [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/oppenheimer-review-the-best-film-christopher-nolans-ever-made):

> [_Oppenheimer_](/movies/872585) draws its figures in vigorous strokes, capturing their hesitancy and certainty, loyalty, and treachery â€” none better than Strauss, whom a tremendous Downey Jr. transforms into the vilest sort of jealous, vindictive rat.

[Dana Stevens](https://twitter.com/thehighsign), [Slate](https://slate.com/culture/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy.html?via=rss):

> His Iron Man exoskeleton now finally retired for good, Downey reminds us what a versatile and emotionally intelligent actor he has always been, while playing a character much colder and more calculating than the charming scamps of his youth.

[Esther Zuckerman](https://twitter.com/ezwrites), [Bloomberg](https://archive.is/BHUHu#selection-5919.0-5923.162):

> [Downey] clearly relishes playing a haughty, deeply insecure villain.

> Downey finally reasserts himself as a generation-defining talent, the reason we ever gave a shit about Tony Stark in the first place.
