> Academy Award nominee Michelle Yeoh has been a worldwide movie star for decades, known for action-packed roles in films such as _Supercop_ and _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ and as a Bond girl in _Tomorrow Never Dies_. But it’s her leading role in _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ that Yeoh says finally let her show what she’s capable of.

> In _Everything Everywhere All at Once_, [Michelle Yeoh] plays Evelyn Wang, a Chinese American immigrant who made a choice decades earlier to leave her parents behind and follow her boyfriend to America. Years later, Eveyln's life is a mess. Her laundromat business is being audited by the IRS, her husband is serving her papers for divorce and she has a tense relationship with her daughter, who is queer.

> Yeoh gives what could very well be the best performance of her career thus far as a character going through a deep mid-life crisis.

> [Yeoh moves] through _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ like she could hold the entire film in the palm of her hand.

[David Ehrlich](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich), [IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-1234707051/):

> It’s Yeoh’s monumental performance that holds the multiverse together, as she skips from slapstick cluelessness to staggering omniscience as fluidly as Evelyn moves between worlds.

> _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ allows Yeoh to revisit the best kind of roles she’s ever had, shine in the kind of roles she was never given, and dive head-first into the kind of roles that have always seemed beneath her... Yeoh’s performance as the ultimate everywoman is uniquely astonishing.

> "Ladies, don’t let anyone tell you you are past your prime," [Yeoh] said on Sunday night, as she collected the first Leading Actress Oscar ever won by an Asian woman. Yeoh is 60; she accepted her award shortly before her co-star, Jamie Lee Curtis (who is 64) collected her first ever Oscar, too.
