[Peter Bradshaw](https://twitter.com/PeterBradshaw1), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/sep/01/poor-things-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone):

> [Emma Stone] gives an amazing and hilarious performance [in [_Poor Things_](/movies/792307)] as the sexual-innocent primitive Bella Baxter, the secret experimental subject and ward of charismatic, troubled anatomist Dr Godwin Baxter (whom she calls “God”).

[John Nugent](https://twitter.com/mr_nugent), [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/poor-things/):

> Bella’s progression is both incremental and rapid: beginning non-verbally, she slowly builds a vocabulary, ending the film as a thesaurus-verbose polymath, gleeful in her curiosity, incautious in her lack of filter.

[Christy Lemire](https://twitter.com/christylemire), [RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/poor-things-movie-review-2023):

> This could have gone horribly wrong.

> Stone delivers the most astonishing performance, and is perhaps the only actress who could convincingly convey such simultaneous expressions of sincerity, absurdity, intelligence, libidinousness and humor.

[Jane Crowther](https://twitter.com/janevgcrowther), [GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/poor-things-review/):

> Stone aces a cut-glass English accent, as well as the evolution of a woman who goes from being a rapacious consumer of experience (booze, sex, cakes, dancing) to someone who lives on her own terms, sets her own social mores, and determines her place within society.

[Maureen Lee Lenker](https://twitter.com/themaureenlee), [Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/poor-things-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone-mark-ruffalo/):

> Stone is a gifted comedic actress and she is an ideal match for Lanthimos' tone, a strange mix of black comedy, farce, and social commentary.
