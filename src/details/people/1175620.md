> Directed and co-written by Justine Triet, [[_Anatomy of a Fall_](/movies/915935)] explores the ambiguity of our lives, the strange line between reality and fiction, and the emotional toll of not fully knowing the truth.

> What Triet is doing is performing an autopsy on a relationship that, once upon a time, started as a heated romance for a twentysomething couple before responsibilities, resentments, compromises, tragedy, and time slowly asphyxiated it to death.

> Triet’s movie is a monument to the ambiguous and unknown, a labyrinth of half-glimpsed causes and vague, sinister effects.

[Courtney Howard](https://twitter.com/Lulamaybelle), [AV Club](https://www.avclub.com/anatomy-of-a-fall-movie-review-1850913823):

> [Triet's] use of sound unlocks character memories as well as unnerves our senses.

> Working with DP Simon Beaufils, Triet shoots in a style of dynamic realism that’s a high-wire balancing act: The film doesn’t manipulate our sympathies, nor does it feel clinical or detached thanks to fluid shifts in perspective that pull us closer to the characters caught up in the ordeal.

> Triet’s film has the specificity and knottiness of the finest true-crime docuseries, with blood spatter analysis, crime-scene recreations, autopsy reports, and competing testimonials all factoring into its equation.
