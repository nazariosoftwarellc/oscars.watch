<!-- Emily Blunt -->
### Reviews for [_Oppenheimer_](/movies/872585)

[Dan Jolin](https://twitter.com/danjolin), [Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/oppenheimer/):

> Emily Blunt thankfully busts out of the supportive/suffering wife archetype as the alcoholic but sharp-witted Kitty Oppenheimer, who gives us one of the film’s most rousing scenes in an intense verbal duel with bullish lawyer Roger Robb (Jason Clarke).

> Kitty is perhaps the only person who knows the true Robert inside out: the man behind the martyr, skillfully disguised behind his faux humility and a grating “lonely genius” persona.

[Ann Hornday](https://twitter.com/annhornaday), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/07/19/oppenheimer-movie-review/):

> [Kitty morphs] into the film’s most ferocious Cold Warrior, her armor a carapace of pearls, Cherries in the Snow lipstick and righteous rage.

> Blunt brings startling force to the role of a woman who shames her faithless husband with a loyalty that surpasses all reason.
