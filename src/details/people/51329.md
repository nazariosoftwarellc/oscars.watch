### Reviews for [_Maestro_](/movies/523607)

[Ann Hornday](https://twitter.com/annhornaday), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/11/29/maestro-movie-review/):

> In this lively, sometimes deliriously scattershot biopic about the conductor Leonard Bernstein, [Bradley] Cooper doesn’t educate the audience by way of a dutiful Wiki-ography as much as tell us what he thinks matters most about Bernstein’s life: in this case, his relationship with his wife, Felicia, the bisexuality he largely hid, his compulsive curiosity about people and the ecstatic bursts of creativity that sustained him.

> Here, as Bernstein, he’s clad in layers of makeup (the [controversial nose](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/bradley-cooper-maestro-movie-leonard-bernstein-jewish/675106/) looks less pronounced in action) that impressively mimic the man’s real face but somehow make him feel harder to reach.

> Cooper is not only a chameleon, fully embodying Bernstein and his restless genius whilst never striking a false note, but a truly gifted filmmaker.

[Richard Lawson](https://twitter.com/rilaws), [Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/09/maestro-review-more-romantic-melodrama-than-biography):

> Both Cooper and [[Carey] Mulligan](/people/36662) go hard on vocal affect, proudly slather on makeup, practically chain smoke their way through the entire film.

[Jane Crowther](https://twitter.com/janevgcrowther), [GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/maestro-2023-review/):

> Cooper’s uncanny depiction of Bernstein’s delirious, full-body conducting style is impressive and affecting as he leads Mahler’s Second Symphony and his own Mass.
