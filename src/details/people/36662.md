> As Bernstein's wife Felicia Montealegre, Carey Mulligan is the heart of [_Maestro_](/movies/523607).

[Ann Hornday](https://twitter.com/annhornaday), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2023/11/29/maestro-movie-review/):

> Mulligan’s portrayal of this paragon of cosmopolitan elegance is restrained, tasteful, and quietly crackling with repressed anger and confusion.

> It’s hardly an accident that the onscreen title appears over an image of Felicia, or that Mulligan receives top billing.

> Her delivery of the line, “If you’re not careful, you’re going to die a lonely, old queen,” cuts to the bone.
